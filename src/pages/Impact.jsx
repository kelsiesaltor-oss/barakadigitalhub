            <h2>Our Origin: Why We Exist</h2>
            <p>
              Baraka Digital Hub was born out of Baraka Children’s Home. For nearly two decades, the Children’s Home has been a place of refuge, care, and hope for vulnerable children in Kayole, Nairobi.
            </p>
            <p>
              As those children grew, a difficult reality became clear. Many faced an uncertain transition into adulthood, where access to opportunity, employment, and sustainable livelihoods was limited.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Baraka Digital Hub was created to close that gap. It is the bridge between care and independence.</strong>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="about-card accent-purple">
            <h3>The Problem We Address</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Traditional charity systems often lack a clear pathway from care to employment.</li>
              <li>Donations are unpredictable and cannot sustain long-term growth.</li>
              <li>Youth aging out of care frequently lack market-ready skills and professional experience.</li>
              <li>There is no reliable structure linking community support to dignified work.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Baraka Digital Hub exists to change this outcome.</strong>

              From the Children’s Home: young people who grew up in care and are now transitioning into independence through structured digital skills training and paid work.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the wider community: out-of-school youth, orphans, and young women from marginalized backgrounds across Kayole and surrounding neighborhoods.

            <p>
              <strong>We do not define people by where they come from. We define them by what they are ready to build.</strong>
