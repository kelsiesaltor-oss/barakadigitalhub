          <h2>Our story</h2>
          <p>
            Baraka Digital Hub was established from the foundation of Baraka Children's Home, which has served the Kayole community since 2006 as a centre for care, protection, and education for vulnerable children.
          </p>
          <p>
            As children in the home matured, we recognized a gap: excellent care and education, but limited access to sustainable economic opportunity. We started by helping young people access remote work opportunities individually—training them, supporting their onboarding, and guiding them through job platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this experience, we saw a larger opportunity. Individual placements helped, but a centralized model could create greater stability, accountability, and scale. In response, Baraka Digital Hub was created—a professional services organization that bridges the gap between potential and opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we operate as a quality-driven digital services organization focused on delivery excellence, sustainable workforce development, and long-term economic inclusion.

              Founded by <strong>Margrate Kimaru</strong> (lovingly known as <strong>Mama Baraka</strong>), the Children's Home has provided care, protection, and education to vulnerable children in Nairobi for nearly two decades.

            <p>
              Her lifelong dedication to child welfare forms the foundation of everything we do. Baraka Digital Hub is the continuation and evolution of her vision—extending care into opportunity and independence.

            <p>
              “Baraka Digital Hub was built on a simple belief: talent is universal, but opportunity is not. Our vision is to create a pathway where young people from underserved communities can access meaningful digital work, develop globally competitive skills, and build sustainable futures for themselves and their families.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are building more than a workforce centre. We are building a model of economic inclusion powered by technology, discipline, and purpose. Every project delivered is an opportunity created, a skill strengthened, and a future made more stable.

            <p>
              “My life has always been rooted in children — loving them, raising them, and standing beside them through every season of their growth. As Mama Baraka, my deepest calling has been to ensure that no child under our care ever feels forgotten or without a future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Baraka Digital Hub was born from that responsibility and that love. It is an extension of the Children’s Home, built to ensure that our young people step into adulthood with skills, confidence, and opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Care must evolve into empowerment, and charity must grow into dignity. This work is family. It is love translated into opportunity.”
